Internet
    #1Internet
    The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

    What is HTTP?
    HTTP is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.
    
    Browsers
A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.

    DNS
    The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

    Domain Name
    A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system.

    Hosting
    Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.

Version Control Systems
Version control/source control systems allow developers to track and control changes to code over time. These services often include the ability to make atomic revisions to code, branch/fork off of specific points, and to compare versions of code. They are useful in determining the who, what, when, and why code changes were made.

Repo Hosting Services
When working on a team, you often need a remote place to put your code so others can access it, create their own branches, and create or review pull requests. These services often include issue tracking, code review, and continuous integration features. A few popular choices are GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and AWS CodeCommit.
```
```
Relational Databases
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases store data in a series of tables. Interconnections between the tables are specified as foreign keys. A foreign key is a unique reference from one row in a relational table to another row in a table, which can be the same table but is most commonly a different table.
```

```
APIs
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
    REST
    REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.
    JSON APIs
    JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is an encoding scheme that is designed to eliminate the need for an ad-hoc code for each application to communicate with servers that communicate in a defined way. JSON API module exposes an implementation for data stores and data structures, such as entity types, bundles, and fields.
    SOAP
    Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a message protocol for exchanging information between systems and applications. When it comes to application programming interfaces (APIs), a SOAP API is developed in a more structured and formalized way. SOAP messages can be carried over a variety of lower-level protocols, including the web-related Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

```
Caching
Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data or information in a local memory, for a certain time period. So, next time, when the client requests the same information, instead of retrieving the information from the database, it will give the information from the local memory. The main advantage of caching is that it improves the performance by reducing the processing burden
    CDN (Content Delivery Network)
    A Content Delivery Network (CDN) service aims to provide high availability and performance improvements of websites. This is achieved with fast delivery of website assets and content typically via geographically closer endpoints to the client requests. Traditional commercial CDNs (Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, CloudFlare and Fastly) provide servers across the globe which can be used for this purpose. Serving assets and contents via a CDN reduces bandwidth on website hosting, provides an extra layer of caching to reduce potential outages and can improve website security as well
    Client Side Caching
    Client-side caching is the storage of network data to a local cache for future re-use. After an application fetches network data, it stores that resource in a local cache. Once a resource has been cached, the browser uses the cache on future requests for that resource to boost performance.
    Server side
    Server-side caching temporarily stores web files and data on the origin server to reuse later.

When the user first requests for the webpage, the website goes under the normal process of retrieving data from the server and generates or constructs the webpage of the website. After the request has happened and the response has been sent back, the server copies the webpage and stores it as a cache.

Next time the user revisits the website, it loads the already saved or cached copy of the webpage, thus making it faster.
